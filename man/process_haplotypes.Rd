\title{Process Haplotypes for Identity-by-Descent Matrix}
\usage{
process_haplotypes(haps_vec, n_samples, ploidy)
}
\arguments{
\item{haps_vec}{A character vector containing haplotype identifiers.
The vector should contain ploidy * n_samples elements, where consecutive
groups of ploidy elements represent the haplotypes for each sample.}

\item{n_samples}{An integer indicating the number of samples/individuals.}

\item{ploidy}{An integer indicating the ploidy level of the organism
(e.g., 2 for diploid, 4 for tetraploid).}
}
\value{
A symmetric numeric matrix of dimensions n_samples x n_samples
containing the IBD relationship coefficients based on haplotype matching.
}
\description{
Computes an identity-by-descent (IBD) relationship matrix from
haplotype data using the Allele Matching (AM) method. Counts matching
haplotypes between individuals and scales by ploidy.
