Description: SimpleMating is a two core package for cross optimization. It estimates usefulness for a set of crosses, via additive and non-additive effects and also multi-trait scenarios. Furthermore, it select the best crosses based on a target criterion (BLUP, Mean parental value, or Usefulness) and constrain the inbreeding of the next generation.
